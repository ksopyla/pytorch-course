# Professor Torchenstein's Sponsorship Master Plan üß™‚ö°Ô∏è

This document outlines the strategic framework for the PyTorch Course sponsorship program, translating the grand vision into actionable steps. It is a living document, designed to be simple, maintainable, and infused with the spirit of our computational rebellion.


## Considered platforms

GitHub Sponsors - 
pros:
- developer friendly, my target audience probably use github more then BMC, they have a github account
- company friendly, companies trust more github then BMC
- recurrent and one time support is possible
- welcome message after sponsorship - I could customize it, add links to art works, 
- I could add access to private repository with some additional content, but I dont know what exactly I could put there

cons:
- I could add access to private repository with some additional content, but I dont know what exactly I could put there
- there are lack of community posts, where I could share some behind-the-scenes insights, and share some links to Torchenstein gallery, quotes, etc.
- there is no way to create a shop for digital products, like wallpapers, stickers, etc.

Buy Me a Coffee - 
pros:
- personal, friendly, and community-focused, leaning into the story of the creator and the Torchenstein character.
- there is a way to create a shop for digital products, like wallpapers, stickers, etc.
- there are community posts, where I could share some behind-the-scenes insights, and share some links to Torchenstein gallery, quotes, etc.
- I could create post, galleries, podcasts  
- one time support is possible
- recurrent support is possible with detailed configuration
- many integrations with other services like twitter to automatically shout-out the sponsors, IFTTT or zapier for automations
- integration with Discord to automatically invite the sponsors to the server and assing roles (not now but in the future)
- I could invite and giveaway BMC memberships for a chosen period of time, it could be a good way to add companies employees to the community

cons:
- less trusted platform for companies, I couldnt imagine that company create an account on BMC
- less developer friendly, my target audience probably use github more then BMC, they have a github account
- 5% platform fee on all transactions
- not integrated into GitHub workflow (separate website, requires separate account)
- requires manual management to grant BMC access to GitHub sponsors
- less professional appearance for corporate sponsorships



## 1. Guiding Principles

-   **Simplicity is Key**: We will avoid overly complex tier structures to prevent decision paralysis for supporters and minimize administrative overhead.
-   **Torchenstein's Voice**: All communication must be infused with the unique, passionate, and slightly mad persona of Professor Torchenstein.
-   **Value Over Everything**: Every tier must offer genuine, scalable value to our supporters.
-   **Phased Approach**: We will start with a manageable set of benefits. A private community server (like Discord) is a fantastic idea for the future but is **not** part of the initial launch to ensure we can perfectly execute on our promises.

## 2. Platform Strategy

**Primary Platform: GitHub Sponsors**
- Main payment collection for all recurring support (individuals + companies)
- One-time support option for individuals
- Professional tone: ambitious, impact-oriented, developer-focused
- Integrated "Sponsor" button on GitHub repo
- Zero platform fees
- Target: developers, managers, companies investing in AI education

**Secondary Platform: Buy Me a Coffee**
- Alternative payment option for those who prefer BMC
- Community hub for all sponsors (regardless of platform)
- Digital shop for artwork, wallpapers, and future merch
- Personal tone: friendly, community-focused, Torchenstein story
- Target: individual supporters who want community connection

**The Flow:**
1. Primary CTA: "Sponsor on GitHub" (repo + website)
2. All GitHub sponsors receive welcome message with BMC community invite
3. BMC serves as community hub with posts, galleries, updates
4. BMC shop available to everyone (sponsors + non-sponsors)
5. BMC as alternative payment option with same $7/month tier

**Key Principle:** Payment happens primarily on GitHub (zero fees), community happens on BMC (richer features).

## 3. Tier & Benefit Structure

### 3.3 Target Audience

**Individuals:**

-   **Students and Early-Career Professionals** - Seeking deep, foundational understanding to differentiate themselves in a competitive job market. Moving beyond superficial bootcamp knowledge to build a solid career base.

-   **Researchers and Academics** - Require flexible, profound understanding of PyTorch to implement novel architectures and push the boundaries of the field. Need tools that respect their intelligence and allow for true innovation.

**Unifying Profile:** Developers who value *understanding over memorization*. A self-selecting group of highly motivated, intelligent individuals who represent a premium audience.

**Companies:**

-   Motivated to train their employees in deep technical skills
-   Want to align their brand with the mission of rigorous, first-principles education
-   Understand that the future of AI depends on developers who grasp the "why," not just the "how"
