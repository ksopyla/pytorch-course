## 1. Create a gemini report with the following prompt: 

I'm looking for funding opportunities for my https://pytorchcourse.com projects. Please analyse the project's strong and weak points, visit my sponsor pages and vision pages to better understand the context. 
 The vision and mission on a page: https://pytorchcourse.com/story/vision_and_mission/
The page dedicated to sponsors: https://pytorchcourse.com/story/sponsor/

my https://buymeacoffee.com/ksopyla sponsor page and github sponsor page: https://github.com/sponsors/ksopyla/

I want to optimise my sponsor page and my sponsor profiles, which would be coherent and present a strong vision that people will believe and follow. 
Please propose to me some strategies for tiers, memberships etc, I want something simple and easy to maintain, eg maybe I need only monthly supporters with on simple tier, or maybe 2 tiers for individuals, and for companies,s try to something different, how can I ensure the same experience tiers and profits for companies on github and buymeacoffe. 

Analyse the best sponsor profiles for both platforms, and synthesise the conclusions, tailored to my product and needs. 
Prepare a detailed sponsorship strategy. 

Follow up with me on the next steps:
