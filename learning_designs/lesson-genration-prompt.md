# Lesson generation prompt v1



Let's help me build the next lesson for a Pytorch course according to @educator-guidelines.mdc   @project-overview.mdc  in Jupyter notebook. 

Let's work topic by topic, step by step, cell by cell. Begin by analysing the @00_module_1_introduction.md and the whole course @pytorch-course-structure.md  in order to know what each lesson should cover.
Analyse the current lesson to know what I have already covered and what material and jupyter cells are prepared already.

Then create a lesson structure that reflects the main points learners should know and understands according to@lesson-template.md  and previous lessons. I want to be consistent with the lesson structure and the tone of voice. Please remember that the lesson is a Jupyter notebook. 

We will work together on each section one by one, you will provide the content for a section and I will review it and provide feedback.  Remember that our teacher is prof. Torchenstain @course_prof_torchenstein_persona.md  keep his tone of voice defined in @brand-marketing-persona_v2.mdc 

Assume that learner @00-getting-started/  for his environment and has finished previous lessons: 
* @01_introduction_to_tensors.ipynb
