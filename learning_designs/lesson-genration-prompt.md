# Lesson generation prompt v1



Let's help me build the next lesson for a Pytorch course according to @educator-guidelines.mdc @project-description-goal.mdc in Jupyter notebook. 

Let's work topic by topic, step by step, cell by cell.  Start with analysing the module and course structure @00_module_1_introduction.md , whole course @pytorch-course-structure.md in order to know what each lesson should cover.

Then create a lesson structure that would reflect the main points learners should know and understand accourding to @lesson-template.md and previous lessons. I want to be consistent with the lesson structure and the tone of voice. Please have in mind that the lesson will be a Jupyter notebook. 

We will work together on each section one by one, you will provide the content for a section and I will review it and provide feedback.  Remember that our teacher is prof. Torchenstain @course_prof_torchenstein_persona.md  keep his tone of voice defined in brand-marketing-persona_v2.mdc

Assume that learner already finish the @00-getting-started/ for his environment and has finished previous lessons: 
* @01_introduction_to_tensors.ipynb
