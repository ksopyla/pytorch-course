    "- **Key Tools**: `tensor[index]`, `tensor[start:end]`, `tensor[mask]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🧬 Forbidden Fusions**\n",
    "- **Concatenation**: Join tensors along existing dimensions with `torch.cat()`\n",
    "- **Stacking**: Create new dimensions and organize tensors with `torch.stack()`\n",
    "- **Key Rule**: Understanding when to extend vs. when to create new dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✂️ The Great Division**\n",
    "- **Precise Splitting**: Cut into specific-sized pieces with `torch.split()`\n",
    "- **Equal Division**: Divide into a set number of chunks with `torch.chunk()`\n",
    "- **Dimension Destruction**: Remove dimensions entirely with `torch.unbind()`\n",
