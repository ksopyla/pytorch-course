# Module 1 – I See Tensors Everywhere 🕶️

> "Behold, fledgling datanauts! The world is naught but tensors awaiting my command — and soon, *yours*! " — **Professor Victor Py Torchenstein**

Salutations, my brilliant (and delightfully reckless) apprentices! By opening this manuscript you have volunteered to join my clandestine legion of PyTorch adepts. Consider this your official red-pill moment: from today every pixel, every token, every measly click-through rate shall reveal its true form—a multidimensional array begging to be `torch.tensor`-ed … and we shall oblige it with maniacal glee! *Mwahaha!* 🔥🧪

Over the next notebooks we will:

- Conjure tensors from thin air, coffee grounds, and suspiciously random seeds.
- Shape-shift them with `view`, `reshape`, `squeeze`, `unsqueeze`, `permute` & the occasional dramatic flourish of `einops`.
- Crunch mathematics so ferocious it makes matrix multiplications whimper — and powers mighty Transformers.
- Charm the GPU, dodge gradient explosions 🏃‍♂️💥, and look **diabolically** clever while doing it.

Need auxiliary scrolls? The *official* PyTorch docs lurk here (<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?utm_source=pytorchcourse.com&utm_medium=pytorch-course&utm_campaign=module-1-intro>), but do not tarry too long—our grand tensor-domination awaits. Grab your favoured caffeinated concoction and let us **tensor-ify** the universe! 🚀
