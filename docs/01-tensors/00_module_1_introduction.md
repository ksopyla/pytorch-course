# Module 1 – I See Tensors Everywhere 🕶️

> “There **is** no spoon – there are only tensors.” — *Neo, probably*

Welcome to the tensor dojo! By cracking open this module you've officially taken the red-pill of deep-learning. From here on out you'll recognise that every pixel, every token, every click-through rate is secretly a multidimensional array begging to be `torch.tensor`-ed.

In the next few notebooks we'll summon tensors from thin air, slice them like sushi, bend their shapes like a data-wizard and let autograd do the calculus heavy-lifting while we sip ☕. By the end you'll be able to:

- Create tensors out of numbers, NumPy arrays and pure chaotic randomness.
- Shape-shift them with `view`, `reshape`, `squeeze`, `unsqueeze`, `permute` & friends.
- Crunch serious maths – from element-wise hijinks to the matrix multiplications that power Transformers.
- Charm the GPU, dodge gradient explosions 🏃‍♂️💥, and generally look **very** clever in front of your friends.

Feeling brave? The official PyTorch docs are just a click away (<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?utm_source=pytorchcourse.com&utm_medium=pytorch-course&utm_campaign=module-1-intro>). But for now grab your favourite beverage and let's **tensor-ify** the universe! 🚀
