    "**Use `torch.cat()` when:**\n",
    "- Tensors represent *different parts* of the same data (e.g., different batches of images, different chunks of text)\n",

    "- Example: Concatenating multiple batches of training data\n",

    "**Use `torch.stack()` when:**\n",

    "- You need to create a *new dimension* to organize the data\n",
    "- Example: Combining RGB channels to form a color image, or collecting multiple predictions\n",
