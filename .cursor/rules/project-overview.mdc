# Project Overview: PyTorch Course

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the PyTorch Course project. It covers the project's vision, technical stack, development environment setup, project structure, and key resources.

For details on the course's brand, tone, and the persona of Professor Torchenstein, please refer to the `.cursor/rules/brand-marketing-persona_v2.mdc` file.

## 1. Project Goal & Vision

**Primary Goal:** To create the best free online PyTorch tutorial for understanding the core building blocks of modern AI architectures like Transformers and Diffusion models.

- **URL:** [https://pytorchcourse.com](https://pytorchcourse.com)
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/ksopyla/pytorch-course](https://github.com/ksopyla/pytorch-course)


### Why I created this course:
- I believe that deep understanding of the concepts is key to success in machine learning.
- I believe in open science, knowledge sharing and community.
- I want to give materials that are fun, engaging and easy to understand. To read them like a comic book.
- I share my process, the prompts that I use, the materials everything is on project github
- I try to present material from the real-world examples perspective, 
- I want to have fun making it, I want to deepen my knowledge and skills.
- the new generation needs a new type of education, an education that embraces creativity, that helps to figure out new, efficient ways of training AI models, but they need fun and engaging content. The rebellion concept is really good, I will stick to it. I wouldn't say that knowledge is not available, but we need new methods to teach difficult concepts, and we need a community around that would support each other. I want to empower the new generation, instead of scrolling through social media I want to engage them with something that would develop them

### About the author:
- Krzysztof Sopyla, reseracher, scientist and currently AI R&D leader
- I value openess, transparency and sharing the knowledge.
- I'm humble, try to not be arrogant and overconfident.
- I want to be helpful, not pushy.
- I want to be authentic, not fake.
- I want the building the brand, but not the marketing.
- I want to express my creativity and my personalit by building this course.

## 2. Content & Educational Strategy

-   **Target Audience:** Beginner to advanced ML engineers and researchers who are familiar with Python and linear algebra basics.
-   **Pedagogy:**
    -   Each lesson focuses on a single core concept.
    -   Start with the theory: "What is it and what purpose does it serve?"
    -   Provide simple, hand-verifiable PyTorch code examples.
    -   Progress to more advanced examples with realistic tensor shapes (e.g., for Transformers).
    -   Use analogies, humor, and a clear, logical structure.
-   **Technical Scope:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and the fundamental components of modern neural networks (attention, normalization, embeddings, etc.).

## 3. Website & Technology Stack

The course website is built using **MkDocs** with the **Material for MkDocs** theme.

-   **Configuration:** The main configuration is in `mkdocs.yml`. This file defines the site structure, navigation, theme, and plugins.
-   **Content Rendering:** Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) are rendered directly into the site using the `mkdocs-jupyter` plugin.
-   **Deployment:** The site is automatically built and deployed to **GitHub Pages** via a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/mkdocs-build.yml`. The site is served from the `gh-pages` branch.

## 4. Development Environment

The project is developed on a **Windows 11** environment.

-   **Terminal:** All commands should be Windows-specific and run in **PowerShell**.
-   **Python:** The project uses **Python 3.12**, managed via `pyenv` for Windows.
-   The mkdocs build is done via gihub actions, local deployment is also configured and could be run via `poetry run mkdocs serve`.
-   For github I have mcp server running, so you can use it to run commands.
-   **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are managed with **Poetry**. The dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`. The core  dependencies in pyproject.toml are for runing the lessons, all the dev dependencies are in the `dev` group are for mkdocs building process and building the site.
-   **Virtual Environment:** It is critical to use the correct Poetry virtual environment for all Python-related tasks.
    -   **Path:** `C:\Users\krzys\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\pytorch-course-YUNTNAZF-py3.12`
    -   **Executable:** `C:\Users\krzys\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\pytorch-course-YUNTNAZF-py3.12\Scripts\python.exe`
    -   Always run commands within this environment (e.g., using `poetry run ...`).
