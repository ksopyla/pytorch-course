## Description and scope

Project will give deep and essential knowledge how particular PyTorch building blocs works and how to use them while designing your own architecture. 

The main focus is on understanding how Machine learning concepts could be expressed using PyTorch. 

I have decided to create this course because I want to be albe to read and understand SoTA architecture implementation like (LLaMA, Qwen, Gemini, etc.). 
What I have always felt is that I have lacked of deep understanding of the notation how to express the concepts in the PyTorch code. 


- How the loss functions work, how the input should be prepared and how to interpret the output of particular loss function
- How the matrix operations are performed in PyTorch, how to efficiently use the broadcasting feature, 
- How to understand the Einstein notation and how to
