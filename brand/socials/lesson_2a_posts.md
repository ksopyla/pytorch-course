üß† Just dropped a new lesson in my free PyTorch course!

I've been quietly building - a completely free PyTorch course at https://pytorchcourse.com. 
Today I added "Tensor Surgery & Assembly" lesson. Knowing how to stack, unbind and concat tensors is one of the most practical skill.

What you'll actually learn (no fluff):
* Master tensor slicing and indexing - the foundation of everything in ML
* Join 1D,2D,3D  tensors with torch.cat() and torch.stack() 
* Split tensors like a pro - essential for multi-head attention and real neural networks
* Real-world applications: how Transformers actually split attention heads, how CLIP fuses text+image embeddings

Creating this with Professor Torchenstein (my slightly mad scientist mascot üß™) has been incredibly rewarding. I like him, and I hope that learning with him will be rewarding to you as well.

Here's my ask: If you're learning #PyTorch or want to understand how modern AI actually works under the hood, join me on this journey. 

Start with any lesson, and when you complete one, share it with #Torchenstein - I read every single post and it genuinely makes my day.

The course is completely free and open source. If you find value in it, a ‚≠ê on GitHub would mean the world to me - it helps others discover it too.

Who's ready to dive into some tensor surgery? üî™‚ö°
