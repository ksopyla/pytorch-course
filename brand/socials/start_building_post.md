ðŸ”¥ Sharing a personal journey: Building a free PyTorch course from scratch

For some time, I've been quietly working on something I'm genuinely excited about - a comprehensive, free PyTorch course that makes deep learning fundamentals actually fun to learn.

Instead of dry documentation, I want to create an interactive learning experience featuring "Professor Victor Py Torchenstein" ðŸ§ª - a quirky character who guides learners through everything from tensor summoning to Einstein summation notation. 
The goal? Make complex concepts accessible and genuinely enjoyable to learn.

This is something I believe in and enjoy doing; the project also gives me the opportunity to test the limits of AI content creation. 
I want to experience how hard/easy it is to create a valuable lesson, prepare the images or a short video. 

So far I have learnt that still human touch and imagination are needed :)

This isn't a sprint - it's a marathon project that I'm building gradually, one module at a time. 

ðŸ’¥ The course main page: https://pytorchcourse.com


I want to build openly and transparently with a community and your feedback, and I will document my journey on a blog: https://lnkd.in/drbkMz4u
