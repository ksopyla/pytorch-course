# Professor Torchenstein's Sponsorship Master Plan üß™‚ö°Ô∏è

This document outlines the strategic framework for the PyTorch Course sponsorship program, translating the grand vision into actionable steps. It is a living document, designed to be simple, maintainable, and infused with the spirit of our computational rebellion.

## 1. Guiding Principles

-   **Simplicity is Key**: We will avoid overly complex tier structures to prevent decision paralysis for supporters and minimize administrative overhead.
-   **Torchenstein's Voice**: All communication must be infused with the unique, passionate, and slightly mad persona of Professor Torchenstein.
-   **Value Over Everything**: Every tier must offer genuine, scalable value to our supporters.
-   **Phased Approach**: We will start with a manageable set of benefits. A private community server (like Discord) is a fantastic idea for the future but is **not** part of the initial launch to ensure we can perfectly execute on our promises.

## 2. Platform Strategy

We will utilize two platforms, each with a tailored tone:

-   **GitHub Sponsors**: The "Professional's Portal." The tone will be ambitious and impact-oriented, speaking to developers, managers, and companies about investing in the future of AI education.
-   **Buy Me a Coffee**: The "Supporter's Connection." The tone will be personal, friendly, and community-focused, leaning into the story of the creator and the Torchenstein character.

## 3. Tier & Benefit Structure

Some dos and donts:


What I do not want to do:
-   Private Discord Server: We will not have a private Discord server for now, maybe in the future.
-   Priority Feedback Channel: We will not have a priority feedback channel. 
-   Course Analytics: We will not have course analytics.
-   Exclusive Content ("Professor's Lab Notes"): I do not need to create regular content for Supporters, they will gain access to members-only posts on BMC but this will be limited to some updates and plans for the future, I wont be sharing behind-the-scenes insights, early drafts of new lessons, deeper dives into complex topics, and personal commentary from the lab. 


I we can do:
- digital vault - access to an exclusive and regullary updated collection of Professor Torchenstein artwork, Torchenstein's animations, wallpapers, funny nerdy quotes, and maybe a sticers and other digital creations.
- wall of computational allies - acknowledgment on the official "Wall of Computational Allies" on the sponsor page - github or BMC
- the recognition on Readme will be limited to the company name and logo with link to the company website, there will be 2 tiers for companies - gold and silver - we need better names for them in Torchenstein's voice
- social media shout-out - for individuals supproters will be monthly periodic, aggregated thank-you posts on LinkedIn and X (Twitter) celebrating our apprentices
- for companies supporters will be quarterly, aggregated thank-you posts on LinkedIn and X (Twitter) celebrating our companies
- for companies that support more then 6 months, we could co-create with their marketing team the dedicated posts that will share the common value 
- job post reshare on linkedin - up to 2 job post re-shares on LinkedIn (after 3 months of continuous support) to our audience of motivated ML practitioners.
- virtual event attendance for the company - after 6 months of support, we can explore a virtual event appearance or co-created content to showcase your company's expertise.
- lesson level recognition in the course - your company will be credited within a specific course lesson, immortalized as a key supporter of that piece of knowledge.
- premium brand visibility - your logo gets top-tier, prominent placement on the sponsor page and GitHub README. A shining beacon of your commitment!
- enhanced talent attraction - we'll boost your recruitment efforts by re-sharing up to 4 of your job posts on LinkedIn.
- for a companies I could give a team access to BMC membership giveaway -for 5/10 members for a year depending on the support (even if they are stop supporting)


# main target audience


Individuals:

-   **Students and Early-Career Professionals:** This group seeks the deep, foundational understanding that will differentiate them in a competitive job market. They are motivated by the prospect of building a solid career base, moving beyond the superficial knowledge offered by many bootcamps and tutorials.  
-   **Mid-Career Professionals and Engineers:** These individuals are often caught in the "black-box" trap, using high-level APIs without a true grasp of the underlying mechanics. Their motivation is career advancement, upskilling, and the desire to become true experts who can solve complex, non-standard problems.  
-   **Researchers and Academics:** This segment requires a flexible and profound understanding of PyTorch to implement novel architectures and push the boundaries of the field. They are motivated by the need for a toolset that respects their intelligence and allows for true innovation, something the course's philosophy directly supports.

The unifying psychographic profile across these segments is the developer who values understanding over memorization. This is a self-selecting group of highly motivated, intelligent individuals who represent a premium audience.

Companies:
- why companies should support the course? they are motivated by the need to train their employees and to be aligned with the mission of the course.
- they are motivated by the need to be aligned with the mission of the course.
- Companies that understand the value of deep technical education and want to align their brand with this mission.

 How to keep the github and BMC content in sync? 
 On BMC I can create content, make community posts, etc. on github I can't do that, so what should we do?
