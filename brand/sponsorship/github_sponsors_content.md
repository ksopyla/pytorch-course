## Profile Introduction / `overview.md`

### Headline:
**Sponsor the Future of AI Education: Join the Rebellion Against Shallow Learning!**

### Body:

Hello! I'm Krzysztof Sopyła, a PhD, AI researcher, and the human behind Professor Victor Torchenstein. My mission with the **PyTorch Course** is to build the world's best free resource for understanding the deep, first-principle foundations of modern AI.

**The Problem:** Too much of AI education is a "black box." Tutorials teach you *how* to use an API, but not *why* it works. This creates a skills gap, leaving brilliant minds without the deep intuition needed to innovate and solve truly hard problems.

**Our Solution:** We're creating "Education That Doesn't Suck!" Through the persona of Professor Torchenstein, we make learning PyTorch an engaging, memorable, and intellectually rigorous adventure. Every concept is broken down to its mathematical core, building the kind of deep understanding that empowers the next generation of AI pioneers.

**Why Sponsor?**
Your sponsorship is an investment in vital open-source educational infrastructure. It allows me to dedicate more time to creating high-quality lessons, developing innovative learning tools, and nurturing a community of thoughtful, principled AI practitioners. By supporting this project, you are helping to build a more skilled, creative, and knowledgeable AI ecosystem for everyone.

Join us, and together, let's democratize deep AI knowledge! ⚡️
